            <h1 id="AboutMe">About Me</h1>
            <p>All my life I wanted to learn how to code, so one day in the summer holidays I thought to my self, if others can do it, I can do it, too! I started watching tons of Java tutorials and writing "hello world" applications. That was 4 years ago. Since then I tried a lot, ranging from responsive web applications with Javascript, CSS and HTML to Unity games in c# to Selenium bots with Python.</p>
            <p>Besides programming, I enjoy doing sports, tracking and following the stock market and always learning new things. This page, however, will focus on the documentation of my projects published on GitHub.</p>

            <h2>Minecraft Modding Projects</h2>

            <h2>Services</h2>
            <p>If you like my projects and you would like to have one for yourself but don't really know how to use the Forge API, you can place an order on my Fiverr and I will translate your idea into a Minecraft mod! You can find my Fiverr <a href=" https://www.fiverr.com/christian_gess">here</a>.</p>
