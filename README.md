# About Me 
All my life I wanted to learn how to code, so one day in the summer holidays I thought to my self, if others can do it I can do it too! I started watching tons of Java tutorials and writing "hello world" applications. That was 4 years ago. Since then I tried a lot, ranging from responsive web applications with Javascript, CSS and HTML to Unity games in c# to Selenium bots with Python.

Besides programming, I enjoy doing sports, tracking and following the stock market and always learning new things. This page will focus on the documentation of my projects published on GitHub however.
